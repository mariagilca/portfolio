## Context

While working with OpenLM, a machine-learning observability platform, I delivered architecture guides that visualized every surface where telemetry, policies, and dashboards converged.

## Audience & Problem

Platform engineers struggled to see how collectors, the orchestration layer, and dashboard widgets talked to each other. They needed a single reference that explained the call paths and API guarantees.

## My Approach

I paired with the product architect to redraw the service graph in Figma, then translated each interaction into prose using Docusaurus admonitions and tabs for multiple environments. Every diagram exported straight into the repo to keep version control in sync.

## Outcome & Impact

Engineers cut onboarding time in half because they could reason about rollout blast radius before touching code. Support also deflected tickets by pointing customers to the architecture tour.

## What this sample demonstrates

- Fluency in architecture visualization plus accompanying narrative patterns
- Proactive pairing with engineering to validate data flows and edge cases
- End-to-end docs-as-code workflow inside a Docusaurus project
