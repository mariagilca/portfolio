title: Treating Docusaurus like a docs-as-code platform
description: How I wire review gates, testing, and visual polish into a Docusaurus repo so technical writers can ship like engineers.

## Align docs velocity with product velocity

Docs-as-code succeeds only when writers share the same branching rituals as engineers. Mirror the product repo: one `main` branch, short-lived feature branches, and required status checks. Docusaurus plays nicely when you split configuration (`docusaurus.config.js`, `sidebars.js`) from content so diffs stay readable.

## Keep builds fast and opinionated

Add GitHub Actions jobs for linting MDX, validating links, and generating preview deploys with `docusaurus build`. Cache `node_modules` and the `.docusaurus` output so builds feel instant. A fast signal keeps reviewers engaged.

## Make visual QA effortless

Writers should not guess how gradients or tokens appear on production. Generate preview URLs, but also add Storybook-like MDX playgrounds for components (`GlassCard`, `TagPill`, hero sections). When components evolve the team updates them once and every page inherits the change.

## Capture tribal knowledge in docs

CI secrets, content strategy decisions, voice/tone panels—even launch checklists—belong in the repo. Use MDX admonitions (`:::tip`) to highlight tribal knowledge, and include runnable snippets so future contributors can extend your work without Slacking you.
