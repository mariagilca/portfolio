## Context

This sample packages the GitHub Actions pipeline I built so that every docs pull request generates previews, lints MDX, and syncs changelogs with product releases.

## Audience & Problem

Documentation engineers and release managers wanted a reproducible pipeline plus onboarding docs for contributors unfamiliar with CI/CD best practices.

## My Approach

I documented the pipeline design (jobs, caching, secrets) alongside ready-to-use workflow YAML. Contributors get copy-paste commands, troubleshooting matrices, and rollback recipes.

## Outcome & Impact

Preview builds now appear in under four minutes and reviewers catch issues earlier because the docs pipeline mirrors the product build pipeline.

## What this sample demonstrates

- How I explain CI/CD concepts with diagrams, tables, and concise callouts
- Opinionated defaults for linting, link checking, and accessibility tests
- A writer-friendly way to extend the pipeline for future products
