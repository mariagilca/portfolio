title: Designing technical docs with gradients (without sacrificing clarity)
description: Practical steps I use to bring nebula gradients and glassmorphism into technical documentation while keeping accessibility top of mind.

## Structure first, gradients second

Break pages into predictable sections (`PageSection`, `GlassCard`, `Grid`). Once the hierarchy is obvious you can layer gradients behind them. In Docusaurus, I keep gradients inside dedicated components so color tokens remain reusable and easy to update.

## Use gradients to guide attention

Instead of drenching the whole viewport, anchor gradients in the corners. In my hero sections I position blurred `ColorBlob` components to highlight CTAs or diagrams. Motion makes gradients feel alive, so add subtle transforms on hover or scroll to reward interaction.

## Keep glassmorphism readable

Transparency is tricky for docs because we render code blocks, tables, and diagrams. Add thicker borders (`--color-border-subtle`) and drop shadows behind glass cards. Pair that with high-contrast text colors and generous padding; your readers will thank you.

## Document the design system like any other feature

Writers should know how to use the gradient language. I document examples, dos/don'ts, and token references in the repo so future contributors stay on-brand without pinging a designer.
