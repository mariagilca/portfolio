Once the hierarchy is obvious you can layer gradients behind them. In Docusaurus, I keep gradients inside dedicated components so color tokens remain reusable and easy to update.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Use gradients to guide attention\\n\\nInstead of drenching the whole viewport, anchor gradients in the corners. In my hero sections I position blurred `ColorBlob` components to highlight CTAs or diagrams. Motion makes gradients feel alive, so add subtle transforms on hover or scroll to reward interaction.\\n\\n## Keep glassmorphism readable\\n\\nTransparency is tricky for docs because we render code blocks, tables, and diagrams. Add thicker borders (`--color-border-subtle`) and drop shadows behind glass cards. Pair that with high-contrast text colors and generous padding; your readers will thank you.\\n\\n## Document the design system like any other feature\\n\\nWriters should know how to use the gradient language.

Mirror the product repo: one `main` branch, short-lived feature branches, and required status checks. Docusaurus plays nicely when you split configuration (`docusaurus.config.js`, `sidebars.js`) from content so diffs stay readable.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Keep builds fast and opinionated\\n\\nAdd GitHub Actions jobs for linting MDX, validating links, and generating preview deploys with `docusaurus build`. Cache `node_modules` and the `.docusaurus` output so builds feel instant. A fast signal keeps reviewers engaged.\\n\\n## Make visual QA effortless\\n\\nWriters should not guess how gradients or tokens appear on production. Generate preview URLs, but also add Storybook-like MDX playgrounds for components (`GlassCard`, `TagPill`, hero sections). When components evolve the team updates them once and every page inherits the change.\\n\\n## Capture tribal knowledge in docs\\n\\nCI secrets, content strategy decisions, voice/tone panels\u2014even launch checklists\u2014belong in the repo.
