## Context

Maria Gilca builds design-forward documentation programs for developer platforms and product teams that want their docs to feel as polished as their UI. This portfolio outlines the recurring systems she delivers: docs-as-code governance, visual storytelling, and localization workflows that scale.

## Audience & Problem

Engineering leaders, DevRel managers, and design systems teams need to understand how Maria partners with them when launch dates are tight and tooling is messy.

## My Approach

I start with a discovery sprint to map the current content, git flows, and review paths. From there I select the right Docusaurus plugins, define a release cadence that mirrors the product roadmap, and ship living style guides so writers and engineers share the same source of truth.

## Outcome & Impact

Teams gain line-of-sight into every doc change, can preview localized builds, and have repeatable CI/CD recipes that make documentation updates as safe as code refactors.

## What this sample demonstrates

- How I translate ambiguous documentation goals into a prioritized backlog
- My focus on design parity between the product UI and the docs experience
- The systems thinking I bring to doc architecture, automation, and governance
