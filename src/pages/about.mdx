# About Maria

I’m Maria Gilca, a technical writer who treats documentation as product design. I partner with teams shipping complex developer platforms and make sure their docs keep pace with every pull request.

## Specialties

- **Docs-as-code coaching** – branch strategies, templates, and linters that give writers autonomy while keeping engineering confidence high.
- **Docusaurus v3 expertise** – custom themes, MDX component systems, and visual storytelling that mirrors product UI.
- **CI/CD and Git flows** – preview builds, automated QA, and release cadences that map to real product launches.
- **Localization workflows** – SLAs, tooling integrations, and governance that keep global docs shippable.
- **Architecture visualization** – Figma + MDX diagrams that clarify service relationships.
