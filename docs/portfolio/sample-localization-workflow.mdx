## Context

For a fintech client shipping across seven markets, I rebuilt the localization pipeline so English source files versioned in git could sync with translators in Phrase.

## Audience & Problem

PMs and localization leads needed confidence that new feature docs would localize without breaking release dates or style consistency.

## My Approach

I codified the localization contract: branching strategy, string freeze checkpoints, and a matrix showing who approves what. The guide also includes scripts for detecting stale translations.

## Outcome & Impact

Localized docs now ship within 48 hours of the English release, stakeholders can preview locale builds automatically, and translators see diffs in context.

## What this sample demonstrates

- My ability to choreograph complex review chains with clear SLAs
- Tooling knowledge that bridges git, TMS platforms, and Docusaurus plugins
- How I document governance so global teams stay in sync
